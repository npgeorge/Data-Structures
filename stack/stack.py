"""
A stack is a data structure whose primary purpose is to store and
return elements in Last In First Out order. 

1. Implement the Stack class using an array as the underlying storage structure.
   Make sure the Stack tests pass.
2. Re-implement the Stack class, this time using the linked list implementation
   as the underlying storage structure.
   Make sure the Stack tests pass.
3. What is the difference between using an array vs. a linked list when 
   implementing a Stack?

The functions associated with stack are:

empty() – Returns whether the stack is empty – Time Complexity : O(1)
size() – Returns the size of the stack – Time Complexity : O(1)
top() – Returns a reference to the top most element of the stack – Time Complexity : O(1)
push(g) – Adds the element ‘g’ at the top of the stack – Time Complexity : O(1)
pop() – Deletes the top most element of the stack – Time Complexity : O(1)
